define('WPS3_BUCKET', 'bucketname');
// region of bucket
define('WPS3_REGION', 'de-de');
// The folder within bucket to store files into
define('WPS3_FOLDER', '/');
// Should S3 access use pathstyle urls
define('WPS3_PATHSTYLE', true);

// URL to access the uploaded assets
define('WPS3_URL_PREFIX', 'https://s3.company.com/bucketname/');
